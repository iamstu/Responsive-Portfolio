            Hi, my name is Stuart LaFollette and this is where I keep my argument for why I would make a great web developer. As you browse this portfolio you may notice many of my technical abilities in web development. I believe these can speak for themselves.

            However, what goes unsaid in the demonstration of these abilities is where I draw the midset to create in a unique and effective way. This stems from the combination of a background in creativity and a formal training in logic.

                Much of my time has always been dedicated to the arts of music and story telling. I cary this way of thinking into everything I do. On top of that I also have a bachelor's degree in philosophy which grants me a the ability to follow ideas to their logical (or illogical) outcomes. I can think of outlandish ideas and use my training in logic and the meticulous way of thinking it provides to make those ideas in to a reality. I would love to show you more of what I can accomplish with these tools by my side.
